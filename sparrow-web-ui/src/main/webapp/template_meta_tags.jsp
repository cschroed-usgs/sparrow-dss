		Tell newer versions of IE to pretend they are IE8 (or 7 if needed.)
		The version of EXT used in the project is not aware of versions beyond
		IE8, so EXT assumes its running in IE6 and pops up warning messages.
		This also seems to more reliably turn off IE compatability mode, preventing
		JS errors that would occur otherwise.
