Run move-libs, clean, and the dist tasks in build.xml.

Note:  You must ensure that the web.xml file has the proxy services pointed
to the correct sparrow_core deployment.  Most of the time that means it can
just point back to the same machine.

Currently there are two test servers:

>> BBG - Development (Test Releases for in-office testing) <<
Tomcat Manager: http://igsarmewfsbbg.er.usgs.gov:8080/manager/html
Manager login: tc_admin (see an administrator for the pwd)
To restart, ssh to machine and as the tomcat user (see an administrator for the pwd).
In your home directory, look for ~/bin/startup.sh or shutdown.sh

>> NOT CURRENTLY USED: MV1A - Test (Unstable testing deployments) <<
Tomcat Manager: http://igsarmewwbmv1a.er.usgs.gov:8080/manager/html
Manager login: tc_admin (see an administrator for the pwd)
This server was setup by John Anderson and has some goofy configuration.
Don't attempt to restart it - if problems, ask John or an admin to restart.


>>>>> Production Deployment <<<<<

Deploy the GUI to three production servers:
http://cida-wiwsc-int-javaprod1a.er.usgs.gov (a, b, & c)

The manager app is at:
http://cida-wiwsc-int-javaprod1a.er.usgs.gov/manager/html (a, b, and c)
user: tomcat, pwd same as tc_admin

Note that for each deployment, the servlet proxy will need to be pointed to one
of the two mapviewer servers:

http://igsarmewwbmv1a:8080/sparrow_mv (a & b)

This url is not considered the final url for the mv servers, but is what can
be used currently for inter-machine communication.
