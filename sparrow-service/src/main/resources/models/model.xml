			<h2>Change Inputs</h2><br/>
			Change inputs is used to create different management scenarios (changes in model source inputs) 
			and to evaluate the changed results with respect to predicted total and incremental load and yield. Changes
			can be made in one of two ways: by applying changes to individual reaches or by applying changes
			to  groups of reaches.<br/>
			<br/>
			To change an individual reach's source inputs, first identify the reach on the map.
			You can identify a reach either by clicking on it with the <b>Identify Reach</b> tool
			or by searching for it via the <b>Find a reach...</b> button. Once the reach has been
			identified, navigate to the <b>Model Source Inputs</b> tab, enter the desired input
			values into the <b>Override</b> column, and click <b>Apply</b>.  Changes will be displayed on the map the next time the map is updated.<br/>
			<br/>To change a group of reaches, you must first create a <i>reach group</i> 
			of reaches. After identifying a candidate reach on the map, navigate to the 
			<b>Change Inputs</b> tab to add it to a group. Once groups are created, 
			right-click the group name on the <b>Change Inputs</b> tab and then apply the desired treatments.
		</Term>
		<Term id="Targets">
			<h2>Downstream Tracking</h2><br/>
			
			Downstream tracking is used to determine the fraction of load from upstream reaches delivered 
			to a selected downstream reaches. To select downstream reaches, find the desired reach on the map
			 (using the <b>Identify Reach tool</b>) and then click on the 
			<b>Add Reach to Selected Downstream Reaches</b> button. Alternatively, you may search for reaches either 
			individually or all at once using the <b>Find a reach...</b> button.

			<p>The US is divided into 8 major river basins: New England and Mid-Atlantic; South Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee; Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi and Souris-Red-Rainy; Missouri; Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red and Texas-Gulf; Rio Grande, Colorado and Great Basin; Pacific Northwest; and California.</p>
		</Term>
		<Term id="Data Series">
			<h2>Data Series</h2><br/>
			<p>The <i>Data Series</i> specifies which data (model output or input) are drawn on the map.
			The most commonly selected data are <i>Total Load</i> estimates,
			which represent the average mass of constituent transported by a stream, as predicted by the model.</p>
			
			<p>
				
				
			</p>
			<p>The complete list of data series:</p>
			<!-- This list updated April 12, 2011 by LM -->
			<dl>
				<dt>Total Load</dt><dd>
					The mean annual load of the constituent (mass in kg per year)
					leaving each stream reach, as predicted by the model. 
					The load reflects the accumulated mass of the constituent 
					contributed by all sources in the total drainage area upstream 
					of the reach outlet. The load includes the effects of in-stream
					attenuation processes in all upstream reaches. 
					The mean annual load is a standardized measure of the constituent
					mass in the stream that reflects the mean quantities of mass
					that are likely to occur during a specified base year under
					long-term mean streamflow conditions.
					The mean annual conditions described by the model 
					primarily reflect the effects of natural
					and human-related processes that supply and remove 
					constituent mass in watersheds over long time periods. 
					You can select 'All Sources' to map the total load for all of the
					sources together, or select an individual model source to map the
					theoretical load due to a single source.
				</dd>
                <dt>Standard Error of Total Load</dt><dd>
                	An estimate of the prediction error associated with the <i>Total load</i>, 
                	based on the model calibration.
                	Units are the same as the units for <i>Total load</i>.
                </dd>
                <dt>Incremental Load</dt><dd>
					The mean annual load of the constituent (mass in kg per year)
					leaving the incremental drainage area of an individual stream reach.
					The load value reflects the effects of in-stream attenuation
					processes associated with one half of the reach time of travel
					(this assumes that the entire load of the incremental drainage area
					enters the reach at approximately the midpoint, between the upstream and
					downstream end).  You can select 'All Sources' for all of the sources
					together, or select an individual model source to map the
					theoretical incremental load due to a single source.
                </dd>
                <dt>Standard Error of Incremental Load</dt><dd>
					An estimate of the prediction error associated with the <i>Incremental Load</i>,
					based on the model calibration.
					Units are the same as the units for <i>Incremental Load</i>.
				</dd>
                <dt>Incremental Yield</dt><dd>
                	The <i>Incremental Load</i> divided by the incremental
                	drainage area of the reach.
                	Units are mass in kg per square kilometer per year. Incremental yield
                	removes the variability due to differences in drainage area and allows
                	comparison of the export rates from different drainages.
                </dd>
                <dt>Total Yield</dt><dd>
                	The <i>Total Load</i> divided by the total
                	drainage area upstream of the reach outlet.
                	Units are mass in kg per square kilometer per year. Total yield
                	removes the variability due to differences in drainage area and allows
                	comparison of the export rates from different drainages.
                </dd>
                <dt>Flow-weighted Concentration</dt><dd>
                	The mean annual flow-weighted concentration of the constituent in the reach
                	in units of mass per volume.  This is calculated by dividing
                	the <i>Total Load</i> by the <i>Streamflow</i> and converting
                	to standard units.  Annual flow-weighted concentrations generally reflect
                	conditions during higher-flow periods of the year that often occur during
                	the winter and spring.
                </dd>
                <dt>Source Value</dt><dd>
                	The source value is the amount of a particular source
                	added in the reach's drainage area - you must choose a
                	source to map this data series.  If you have created
                	adjustments as part of a 'what if' scenario, the adjusted
                	source values are presented.<br/>
                	In some cases the 'source' is not represented in terms of mass,
                	but rather as a surrogate variable that relfects the spatial variation
                	of a source of the water-quality constituent.  For instance, 
                	a measurement such as urban land area or population may be included as
                	a source term, serving as a surrogate measurement for nutrients in
                	urban runoff, for which direct measurements for each catchment are not
                	available.<br/>
                	Also, consider that some source terms may be interdependent and that
                	changes to one will logically require changes
                	to another.  For example, decreasing the value of the source term <i>Agricultural Land Area</i>
                	(a surrogate for runoff from fertilized agricultural land) could require
                	increasing the value of the source term <i>Developed Land Area</i> 
                	(surrogate for runoff from urban land) for the set of adjusted reaches, if the shift
                	away from agricultural land use in those reaches is expected to be accompanied
                	by a shift towards urban land use.
                </dd>
                <dt>Streamflow</dt><dd>
                	The mean annual stream flow of the reach, in units of volume (cubic feet) per time (second).
                </dd>
                <dt>Delivery Fraction</dt><dd>
                	The fraction (from 0 to 1) of the load leaving a reach that arrives at the
                	end of a selected downstream target reach after accounting for the mass quantity
                	that is removed by natural attenuation processes
                	(e.g., long-term storage; denitrification).
                	You must define at least one <em>Selected Downstream Reach</em> on the <em>Downstream Tracking</em> tab in order to map this series.

			<h2>HUC</h2><br/>
			
			Hydrologic unit code. The United States is divided and sub-divided into successively smaller 
			hydrologic units which are classified into four levels: regions, sub-regions, accounting units, 
			and cataloging units. The hydrologic units are arranged within each other, from the smallest 
			(cataloging units) to the largest (regions). Each hydrologic unit is identified by a unique 
			hydrologic unit code (HUC) consisting of two to eight digits based on the four levels of 
			classification in the hydrologic unit system. The first level of classification (HUC2) divides 
			the Nation into 21 major geographic areas that contain either the drainage area of a major river, 
			such as the Missouri region, or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers, such as the 
			Texas-Gulf region, which includes a number of rivers draining into the Gulf of Mexico. 
			The second level of classification (HUC4) divides the 21 regions into 221 subregions that 
			include the area drained by a river system, a reach of a river and its tributaries in that reach, 
			a closed basin(s), or a group of streams forming a coastal drainage area. The third level of 
			classification (HUC6) subdivides many of the subregions into 378 accounting units that are 
			nested within, or can be equivalent to the subregions. The fourth level of classification 
			(HUC8) includes 2,264 cataloging units, which are geographic areas representing part of all 
			of a surface drainage basin, a combination of drainage basins, or a distinct hydrologic feature.

			__The complete list of data series__
			Any of these data series may be in the Mapped Value column, depending on the data series being mapped at the time of the export.
			
			Total Load
			The mean annual load of the constituent (mass in kg per year) leaving
			each stream reach, as predicted by the model. The load reflects the accumulated mass of the constituent contributed by all sources in the total drainage area upstream of the reach outlet. The load includes the effects of in-stream attenuation processes in all upstream reaches. The mean annual load is a standardized measure of the constituent mass in the stream that reflects the mean quantities of mass that are likely to occur during a specified base year under long-term mean streamflow conditions. The mean annual conditions described by the model primarily reflect the effects of natural and human-related processes that supply and remove constituent mass in watersheds over long time periods. You can select 'All Sources' to map the total load for all of the sources together, or select an individual model source to map the theoretical load due to a single source.
			
			Standard Error of Total Load
			An estimate of the prediction error associated with the total load, based on the model calibration. Units are the same as the units for total load.
			
			Incremental Load
			The mean annual load of the constituent (mass in kg per year) leaving the incremental drainage area of an individual stream reach.  The load value reflects the effects of in-stream attenuation processes associated with one half of the reach time of travel (this assumes that the entire load of the incremental drainage area enters the reach at approximately the midpoint, between the upstream and downstream end). You can select 'All Sources' for all sources together, or select an individual model source to map the theoretical incremental load due to a single source.
			
			Standard Error of Incremental Load
			An estimate of the prediction error associated with the incremental load, based on the model calibration. Units are the same as the units for incremental load.
			
			Incremental Yield
			The incremental load divided by the incremental drainage area of the reach. Units are mass in kg per square kilometer per year.  Incremental yield removes the variability due to differences in drainage area and allows comparison of the export rates from different drainages.
			
			Total Yield
			The total load divided by the total drainage area upstream of the reach outlet.  Units are mass in kg per square kilometer per year.  Total yield removes the variability due to differences in drainage area and allows comparison of the export rates from different drainages.
			
			Flow-weighted Concentration
			The mean annual flow-weighted concentration of the constituent in the reach in units of mass per volume. This is calculated by dividing the total load by the streamflow and converting to standard units.  Annual flow-weighted concentrations generally reflect conditions during higher-flow periods of the year that often occur during the winter and spring.
			
			Source Value
			The source value is the amount of a particular source added in the reach's drainage area - you must choose a source to map this data series. If you have created adjustments as part of a 'what if' scenario, the adjusted source values are presented.
			
			In some cases the 'source' is not represented in terms of mass, but rather as a surrogate variable that reflects the spatial variation of a source of the water-quality constituent. For instance, a measurement such as urban land area or population may be included as a source term, serving as a surrogate measurement for nutrients in urban runoff, for which direct measurements for each catchment are not available.
			
			Also, consider that some source terms may be interdependent and that changes to one (in a what-if scenario) will logically require changes to another. For example, decreasing the value of the source term Agricultural Land Area (a surrogate for runoff from fertilized agricultural land) could require increasing the value of the source term Developed Land Area (surrogate for runoff from urban land) for the set of adjusted reaches, if the shift away from agricultural land use in those reaches is expected to be accompanied by a shift towards urban land use.
			
			Streamflow
			The mean annual stream flow of the reach, in units of volume (cubic feet) per time (seconds).
			
			Delivery Fraction
			The fraction (from 0 to 1) of the load leaving a reach that arrives at the downstream end of a selected downstream reach(es) without any removal by natural attenuation processes (e.g., long-term storage; denitrification).
			
			Incremental Delivered Load
			The incremental load associated with an individual stream reach that arrives at the downstream end of a selected downstream reach(es), in units of mass (kg) per year.
			
			Total Delivered Load
			The total load associated with a stream reach that arrives at the downstream end of a selected downstream reach(es), in units of mass (kg) per year.
			
			Incremental Delivered Yield
			The incremental delivered load divided by the drainage area of the reach, in units of mass (kg) per square kilometer per year.

			__Export Data Column Definitions__
			
			* id:  Unique identifier for a stream reach in the model based on the reference stream network.  See the section 'Linking Exported Data to River Network Shapefiles' for more information on how to use this id.
			* Reach Name (pname): The name of the reach.  This name may sometimes be empty, partial, or different than local names for the reach.
			* EDACODE: NOAA code identifying estuarine/coastal drainage areas for major estuaries in the United States.  This value may be empty for reaches in or draining to Canada.
			* [source name]  (unit): One column per model source.  This is the 'Total Load' data series for an individual source.
			* Total for All Sources (unit): The 'Total Load' data series (the sum of all per-source total loads).
			
			Notes:
			* The loads reported in this export reflect source input changes made on the Change Inputs tab in the application.
			* The predicted load columns are labeled 'Total Delivered Load' for consistancy with the report, however, for these reaches the Total Delivered Load is the same as the Total Load.
			* A more detailed explanation of what these reported values are and how they are calculated is available at:
			http://cida.usgs.gov/sparrow/report/terminal_report_help.jsp
