	<!--
	This request echos back the fully expanded prediction-context.
	
	The use would be to allow the user to download and locally store the prediction
	context so that they can continue work at a later point, or hand-modify the
	prediction-context to handle cases not addressed by the GUI.
	
	This option would also be available via http parameters.
	
	__echo abbribute values__
	full:  Fully expand the components of the prediction-context so that its full
	contents are in the returned document.  The 'echo' attribute should be removed
	from the response document.
	exact:  Echo back the exact document as received.  This is intended as a
	debug option.
	none:  Default - do not echo.
