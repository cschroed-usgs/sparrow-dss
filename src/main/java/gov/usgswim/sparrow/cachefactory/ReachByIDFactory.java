 * This factory finds a Reach based on a ReachID object

 * This class implements CacheEntryFactory, which plugs into the caching system
 * so that the createEntry() method is only called when a entry needs to be
 * created/loaded.
 *
 * Caching, blocking, and de-caching are all handled by the caching system, so
 * that this factory class only needs to worry about building a new entity in
 * (what it can consider) a single thread environment.
