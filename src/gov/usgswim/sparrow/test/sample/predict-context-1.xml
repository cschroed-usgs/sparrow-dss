					I initially selected HUC 01746286 and 01746289,
					but it looks like there are some others plants that need to be included.
					
					As a start, we are proposing a 10% reduction across the board,
					but we will tailor this later based on plant type.

					The Farmer's Alminac says corn planting will be up 20% this year,
					which will roughly result in a 5% increase in the aggrecultural source.
					This is an estimate so I'm leaving it out of the runs created	for the EPA.
