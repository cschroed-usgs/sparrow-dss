Run move-libs, clean, and the dist tasks in build.xml.

For sparrow_core, the sparrow_mv_local includes the JSP (service test) pages,
so this is generally the one to deploy until we are in full production.

>>>>> Database Connection Configuration <<<<<
The embedded Map Viewer server uses its own connection pool.  The config file
for Map Viewer is constructed using XSLT, so there is an .xsl file to edit:
ant-support/ms-datasource-merge.xsl
(note the multi-splendor of the database related attributes)

Aside from drawing maps, the application itself uses a JNDI connection named:
java:comp/env/jdbc/sparrow_dss
Configuring where this name points needs to be done on the server that the
application is running on (i.e., Tomcat)

>>>>> Servers <<<<<
Currently there are two test servers:

>> BBG - Development (Test Releases for in-office testing) <<
Tomcat Manager: http://igsarmewfsbbg.er.usgs.gov:8080/manager/html
Manager login: tc_admin (see an administrator for the pwd)
To restart, ssh to machine and as the tomcat user (see an administrator for the pwd).
In your home directory, look for ~/bin/startup.sh or shutdown.sh

>> NOT CURRENTLY USED: MV1A - Test (Unstable testing deployments) <<
Tomcat Manager: http://igsarmewwbmv1a.er.usgs.gov:8080/manager/html
Manager login: tc_admin (see an administrator for the pwd)
This server was setup by John Anderson and has some goofy configuration.
Don't attempt to restart it - if problems, ask John or an admin to restart.



>>>>> Production Deployment <<<<<

There are currently two production mv servers (even though there are three
production non-mv servers).

http://igsarmewwbmv1a:8080/sparrow_mv (a & b)

The manager is at:
http://igsarmewwbmv1a:8080/manager/html
tc_admin and its pwd.

This url is not considered the final url for the mv servers, but is what can
be used currently for inter-machine communication.
