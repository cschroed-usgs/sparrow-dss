/**
 * This factory class creates adjusted source values on demand for an EHCache.
 * 
 * When the cache receives a get(AdjustmentGroups) call and it doesn't have a cache
 * entry for that request, the createEntry() method of this class is called
 * and the returned value is cached.
 * 
 * This class implements CacheEntryFactory, which plugs into the caching system
 * so that the createEntry() method is only called when a entry needs to be
 * created/loaded.
 * 
 * Caching, blocking, and de-caching are all handled by the caching system, so
 * that this factory class only needs to worry about building a new entity in
 * (what it can consider) a single thread environment.
