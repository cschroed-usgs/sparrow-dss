		<Term id="Adjustments">
			<h2>Adjustments</h2><br/>
			Adjustments allow different management scenarios (changes in model source inputs) 
			to be evaluated with respect to predicted total and incremental flux. Adjustments
			can be made in one of two ways: by adjusting individual reaches or by adjusting groups
			of reaches.<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>To adjust an individual reach's source inputs, first identify the reach on the map.
				You can identify a reach either by clicking on it with the <b>Identify Reach</b> tool
				or by searching for it via the <b>Find a reach...</b> button. Once the reach has been
				identified, navigate to the <b>Model Source Inputs</b> tab, enter the desired input
				values into the <b>Override</b> column, and click <b>Apply</b>.<br/></li>
				<li>To adjust a group of reaches, you must first create an <i>adjustment group</i> 
				of reaches. After identifying a candidate reach on the map, navigate to the 
				<b>Group / Target Membership</b> tab to add it to a group. Once groups are created, 
				right-click the group name on the <b>Adjustments</b> tab and then apply the desired treatments.</li>
			</ul>
		</Term>
		<Term id="Targets">
			<h2>Downstream Tracking</h2><br/>
			
			Downstream tracking is used to determine the fraction of flux from upstream reaches delivered 
			to a specified downstream outlet reach or water body. To specify a downstream outlet reach, identify the 
			desired reach on the map (using the <b>Identify Reach tool</b>) and then click on the 
			<b>Add Reach as Downstream Outlet</b> button. Alternatively, you may search for downstream outlet reaches either 
			individually or all at once using the <b>Find a reach...</b> button

			<h2>Data Series</h2><br/>
			<p>The <i>Data Series</i> specifies what data is drawn on the map.

			<dl>
				<dt>Total Load</dt><dd>
					The mean annual load of the constituent (mass per year)
					leaving each stream reach, as predicted by the model. 
					The load reflects the accumulated mass of the constituent 
					contributed by all sources in the total drainage area upstream 
					of the reach outlet. The load includes the effects of in-stream
					attenuation processes in all upstream reaches. 
					The mean annual load is a standardized measure of the constituent
					mass in the stream that reflects the mean quantities of mass
					that are likely to occur during a specified base year under
					long-term mean streamflow conditions. 
					Spatial variations in the standardized loads are generally
					indicative of conditions during higher-flow periods of
					the year that often occur during the winter and spring.  
					The mean annual conditions described by the model 
					predictions also primarily reflect the effects of natural
					and human-related processes that supply and remove 
					constituent mass in watersheds over long time periods. 
					The predicted load is also "unadjusted" for measured 
					stream load values at monitoring sites; measured loads 
					are commonly substituted for model predictions ("adjusted" loads) 
					in the calibration procedure to ensure accurate estimation of the model.

			<h2>Binning for Map Color and Legend</h2><br/>
			<b>Bins</b> determine how values are grouped and displayed on the map.
			Data are grouped into bins by their values, and data in each bin are

			scheme, you can change the way information is presented on your map.<br/>
			Two auto-generation options are available:
			<dl>
			<dt>Equal Count</dt>
			<dd>Attempt to construct bins such that an equal

			<dt>Equal Range</dt>
			<dd>Construct bins such that each bin has an

			If you check <b>Use automatic binning</b>, SPARROW DSS will choose a binning scheme for you
			based on the map options you have selected. The recommended binning will consist of 5 bins of

			<h2>HUC</h2><br/>
			
			Hydrologic unit code. The United States is divided and sub-divided into successively smaller

			and cataloging units. The hydrologic units are arranged within each other, from the smallest 
			(cataloging units) to the largest (regions). Each hydrologic unit is identified by a unique 
			hydrologic unit code (HUC) consisting of two to eight digits based on the four levels of 
			classification in the hydrologic unit system. The first level of classification (HUC2) divides 
			the Nation into 21 major geographic areas that contain either the drainage area of a major river, 
			such as the Missouri region, or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers, such as the 
			Texas-Gulf region, which includes a number of rivers draining into the Gulf of Mexico. 
			The second level of classification (HUC4) divides the 21 regions into 221 subregions that 
			include the area drained by a river system, a reach of a river and its tributaries in that reach, 
			a closed basin(s), or a group of streams forming a coastal drainage area. The third level of 
			classification (HUC6) subdivides many of the subregions into 378 accounting units that are 
			nested within, or can be equivalent to the subregions. The fourth level of classification 
			(HUC8) includes 2,264 cataloging units, which are geographic areas representing part of all

			Data Series Help:
			The Data Series specifies what data is drawn on the map. The most common model output is the Total Load, which is the average amount of the constituent you would expect to find in a stream, as predicted by the model.

			Source Value
			The source value is the amount of a particular source added in the reach's drainage area - you must choose a source to map this data series. If you have created adjustments as part of a 'what if' scenario, the adjusted source values are presented.

			Any increase from a original value of zero is considered a 100% change. Any decrease from an original value of zero is considered a -100% change.
