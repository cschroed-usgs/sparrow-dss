This folder should contain predict.txt files for each model loaded in the database.
The file should be renamed X.txt where X is the model number in the db.

The columns in each file should be renamed as follows:
i1 - ix : Incremental predicted load for sources 1 - x
t1- tx : Total predicted load for sources 1 - x
ia : Incremental predicted load for all sources
ta : Total predicted load for all sources
