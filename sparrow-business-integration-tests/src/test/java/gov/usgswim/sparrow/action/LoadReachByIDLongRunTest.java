/**
 * There is one 'hole' in this set of tests.  To save a bit of work, we did not
 * manually load all upstream values into the .tab files - we stopped at reach 9681.
 * For incremental tests, we turn off transport for 9681 allowing the test to
 * validate that all reaches not listed in the .tab are zero.  For total
 * comparisons where the upstream values are important we can't do that
 * w/o generating values that can't be matched to what you would be able to
 * see/validate in the UI, so we leave the transport for reach 9681 ON.
 * 
 * As a consequence, total comparison are not able to exhaustively exclude that
 * there may be non-upstream values which are non-zero, as well as upstream
 * reaches which could be incorrect.
