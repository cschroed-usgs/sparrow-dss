	<!-- run request
	We need to be able to store the predict requests in a chache w/ a transact ID
	so they can be refered to later.  Its a seperate issue to cache an entire
	service request, which contains much more info (when we we use this?).
	However, a MV request needs the predict request, the comp type, and the primary
	data series in order to have all the info needed for mapping.
	
	How do we bring all of that together?
	
	Maybe we need to store entire predict service requests, rather then just
	predict requests.  Or we could do both and allow a predict service request
	refer to the a predict request trans ID.
