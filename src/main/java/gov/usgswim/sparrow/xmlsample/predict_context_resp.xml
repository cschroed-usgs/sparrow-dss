	<!--
	The response document indicates that the submission was received and will
	be stored on the server for 86400 seconds (24 hours).  During that time, this
	prediction context can be refered to by the context-id (389392 from above),
	or the four pieces of the prediction context can be used seperately via their
	individual context-id's (below).

	Any use of the prediction context (or any piece of it) will reset the cache
	timer.

	The treatment groups, terminus-reaches, and areaOfInterest are all very
	model specific, so it seems like this document should continue to contain
	the model-id (at top) to reflect that.
